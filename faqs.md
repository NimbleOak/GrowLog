### Can I postpone the alarm?
Yes, you can postpone the alarm by specifying number of days by which the alarm should be postponed. Press the snooze icon button for the particular plant activity to postpone that alarm.

### Why is the 'X days' text shown in every item below the date and time in history screen?
This is the difference in days between the current and previous session. For example, in Watering history, this will indicate the number of days after which this Watering session was performed.

### What is 'Edit last done' that's accessed using pencil icon?
This feature is indicated by the pencil icon for each plant activity item. It allows you to edit the date and time for the previous session of that plant activity. For example, when you touch the checkmark icon for performing a particular activity, the app records the current and time for that session. But if you have done that activity, for example, 3 hours ago, not now, in that case the 'Edit last done' (the pencil icon), allows you to specify the date and time of the previous session. For recording the activity done in the past, you should always touch the checkmark button first to perform the action for the current date and time and then edit the date and time using the pencil icon. Use this feature carefully, because it overwrites the history till the date and time you pick.
